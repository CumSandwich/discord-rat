## Setup
The first step in getting this bot running is creating a Discord bot. This can be done by signing into Discord in your browser and then going to the [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers) webpage. After downloading the Python script, place the bot's token in the last line. You may also change the bot's prefix. To run the bot, you must have all of the required modules installed. This can be done by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. You may then run the script. After the word *Ready* flashes on the console window, the bot is up and running.

## Usage
For information about the command syntax, use ```$help``` followed by the name of the command to get a detailed description on what it does and how to use it. If you want to hide tne default console window, change the file extension to ```.pyw```.
